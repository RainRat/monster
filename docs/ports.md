## PORTING GUIDE

Porting Monster to another 6502-based platform requires implementing a few components.

Here is a basic list of the implementation required:

 - SCREEN:    routines to setup, clear, and save/restore the contents of the screen
 - TEXT:      routines to draw text to the screen
 - AUDIO:     routines to produce beeps
 - MEMORY:    implementations to call procedures throughout the 24 bit address space
 - FILE:      routines to save/load files
 - INTERRUPT: the main IRQ that handles platform specific visual, audio, etc. functionality

### MEMORY
To function _at all_, Monster needs a way to the address 24-bit space.
The placement of your code may vary depending on the memory map of the target, so Monster needs to be
able to call code that resides in other RAM banks.

Beginning with the linker file, Monster expects certain _segments_ to be available no matter which
bank is active.  This may require copying the code for these segments to all blocks.

* IRQ
* BANKCODE
* BANKCODE2

Monster also expects the following memory addresses to be accessible from all banks.
* ZEROPAGE ($00-$100)
* STACK ($100-$200)
* SHAREBSS

If your target swaps these upon switching banks, you will need to make sure an update to a value
in this space is applied to the same address in all the other banks.  Thankfully, it is common
to have granular control over the memory that is bank-switched, and the space needed for `SHAREBSS`
is small.

NOTE: When designing your link configuration file, try to keep most of the code in the same bank. This will
reduce the overhead of procedure calls.

The next step is providing a means to call routines in other banks and write/read to memory locations in them.
To do this requires implementing a couple macros.

For machines that have a full 64k of RAM, it may not be necessary to ever switch banks for code execution
(in other words the `CALL` macro can always resolve to a `JSR`), but you will still need to provide a way for
source code, label names, etc. to be stored somewhere in the 24 bit address range.

If the target has, say, 32K of RAM addressable like the Commodore Vic-20, execution will need to
happen in multiple banks.  It is important that the implementation of `CALL` for these platforms is
bank-independent.  Calling a routine via `CALL` must return to the bank that the procedure was called from.

For simplicity, a single segment should be within a single bank.  Code within a bank can `JSR` to other
routines in the segment freely.

|  MACRO                  | DESCRIPTION
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `CALL <PROC>`           | Within the same bank evaluates to a JSR, otherwise switches to the correct bank and calls PROC

### SCREEN
The screen routines provide the implementation for things like clearing the screen or changing its
color. Below list of procedures that must be implemented to do this.

|  PROCEDURE              | DESCRIPTION
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `__screen_init`         | initialize the display for future screen procedures
| `__screen_clr`          | clear the whole screen
| `__screen_clrcolor`     | reset the entire screen to its default color state
| `__screen_clrpart`      | clear all character rows below the one given in `.A`
| `__screen_clrline`      | clear the character row given in `.A`
| `__screen_rvsline`      | reverse all characters in the row given in `.A`
| `__screen_rvsline_part` | reverse the characters between columns `[.Y, .X]` in the row given in `.A`
| `__screen_save`         | save the contents of the screen to be later restored by `__screen_restore`
| `__screen_restore`      | restore the contents last saved by `__screen_save`

### TEXT
Rendering text only requires one procedure to be implemented.

|  PROCEDURE              | DESCRIPTION
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `puts`                  | renders the text string whose address is given in `.YX` at the row in `.A`

### DRAW
The _DRAW_ routines serve mostly to set the colors for given rows of characters.

Besides `draw::line` these still operate on characters, so you may, for example, reverse the "colored"
characters instead of coloring them.

To implement `draw::line` on a a target that cannot render to a bitmap, you may devise some other way of
representing this.  Note that this routine is used to emphasize the current line while debugging, so
it should be implemented somehow.

|  PROCEDURE              | DESCRIPTION
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `__draw_hline`          | set the color for the row in `.X` to the color given in `.A`
| `__draw_rvs_underline`  | EOR the _pixel_ row given in `.A`
| `__draw_scrollcolorsu`  | Scrolls all character colors within the rows `[X., .Y]` up by `.A` characters
| `__draw_scrollcolorsd`  | Scrolls all character colors within the rows `[X., .Y]` down by `.A` characters
| `__draw_coloroff`       | Disables color until reenabled by calling another draw routine

### CURSOR
There is only one cursor routine that needs to be implemented.

|  PROCEDURE              | DESCRIPTION
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `__cur_toggle`          | toggles the cursor state (on/off) for the cursor position in `(zp::curx, zp::cury)`

### IRQ
The IRQ routines are intended to setup a stable interrupt that runs at 60 Hz.
Stability is only necessary if you choose to do raster-based effects to achieve some of the draw (color)
functionality.

|  PROCEDURE              | DESCRIPTION
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `__irq_on`              | Initializes and enables the IRQ for Monster
| `__irq_off`             | Disables the IRQ until reenabled

### FILE
At the moment, the file routines are built for Commodore computers.
See `file.asm` for the routines that must be modified to support other targets.  Also note that
the `$FFD2` KERNAL vector is used (sparingly).  This routine, which outputs a character to the current
file, also needs to be implemented/replaced to support the target.

### AUDIO
Simple audio routines will produce basic beeps when implemented.  These can be implemented as no-ops safely.

Producing the sound should be done in a non-blocking way, so you will probably want to implement a counter/timer
and update the sound registers for the target machine's IRQ.

|  PROCEDURE              | DESCRIPTION
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `__beep_short`          | Produces a "short" beep sound
| `__long_short`          | Produces a "long" beep sound
