#### MONster
MONster is an all-in-one editor/assembler/memory editor for the Commodore Vic-20.
In its current form, it is primarily intended for native development of applications for the
unexpanded Commodore Vic-20.

Features include:
 - 40 column bitmap-based editor
 - interactive debugger
 - memory viewer/editor
 - directory viewer (on top of basic file I/O)

#### Requirements
 MONster requires a _completely_ expanded (BLK 2,3, and 5) RAM configuration to function.

 I do plan to support configurations with banked memory so that one can isolate the 
 development memory from the programs, however there are limited hardware options that support
 this available (only the discontinued Ultimem to my knowledge).
